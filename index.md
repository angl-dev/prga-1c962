  #   content: >-
  #     RTL-level or even lower-level modeling enables the study on the
  #     underlying configuration circuitry which programs all the LUTs, switches
  #     and other programmable modules. PRGA supports the customization of the
  #     configuration circuitry, as well as the creation of new types of
  #     configuration circuitry.

    title: Heterogeneous Architecture
    content: >-
      This custom FPGA has an embedded hard
      [PicoRV32](https://github.com/cliffordwolf/picorv32) core (the large orange
      block in the middle), in addition to two types of CLBs (light and dark purple
      blocks), and some BRAM blocks (narrow cyan blocks).
      This figures shows the
      [picosoc](https://github.com/cliffordwolf/picorv32/tree/master/picosoc)
      design implemented on this custom FPGA.

    title: Multi-Modal Primitives
    content: >-
      PRGA supports multi-modal primitives. This figure shows a fracturable
      LUT3, which may be used as one single `LUT3` or two `LUT2`s with shared
      inputs. PRGA also provides an API for designing your own multi-modal
      primitives.
